Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol validator using clojure.spec <br/>


TODO include clojar tag
TODO (10) write nice README 
     ;TODO which features?

TODO (11) publish on Clojars


; component :content :attrs -> always "No..." of type NUMINGROUP == first field in group
; component :content :content is array of all repeated fields -> multiple of NUMINGROUP

; message > component > group -> group never directly part of message
; component > group > component -> groups can contain components

; components and fields can have the same name "DerivativeSecurityXML"

; component definitions don't have "required" within top-level attrs -> only the usages have


## Features

Validation features:
* Complete StandardHeader validation including "fixed ordering" tags like BeginString, BodyLength, MessageType
* Complete StandardTrailer validation including checksum calculation
* Data type of every single tag included in the message is checked: e.g. UTCDateOnly, TZTimeOnly, Country, MultipleCharValue ... 
* Allowed enums for tag values are considered: e.g. some allowed values for the field ExecInst (18): <br/>
7 = Strict scale <br/>
B = OK to cross <br/>
G = All or none - AON <br/>
j = Single execution requested for block trade
* Distinguishes between required/non-required fields according to the component definition
* Deep message validation: according to the message type definition specified through the tag MessageType (:35), 
the message can contain nested combinations of components and groups. The validation is executed according to this 
nested structure. Fields that are contained in an embedded component or group are validated in their respective context,
meaning that possible field repetitions are evaluated with repect to their surrounding structures. 
* Group validation considers the preceding num-in-group field, which defines the numbers of repetitions of the proceeding group. 
A divergence between the num-in-group count and the actual number of repetitions will fail the validation.
* The ordering of tags is considered arbitrary for fields of the same component (this might not be 100% accurate in all possible cases!),
but fixed for the fields of the same group.
* In case of invalid messages, a (hopefully helpful) log statement indicates the reason why the validation failed.

TODO forgot some feature?


Note: The validation FIX message validation functionality provided in this library does not 
cover 100% of all restrictions defined within the FIX protocol: some requirements are on ..............

TODO
example for the above:
l = Suspend on system failure (mutually exclusive with H and Q)
m = Suspend on Trading Halt (mutually exclusive with J and K)
n = Reinstate on connection loss (mutually exclusive with o and p)
o = Cancel on connection loss (mutually exclusive with n and p)


## Generating FIX Definitions

 Add description for `lein gen` -> code generation necessary when no definitions present

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.
